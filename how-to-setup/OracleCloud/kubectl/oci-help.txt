Usage: oci [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  Oracle Cloud Infrastructure command line interface, with support for Audit,
  Block Volume, Compute, Database, IAM, Load Balancing, Networking, DNS, File
  Storage, Email Delivery and Object Storage Services.

  Most commands must specify a service, followed by a resource type and then
  an action. For example, to list users (where $T contains the OCID of the
  current tenant):

    oci iam user list --compartment-id $T

  Output is in JSON format.

  --cli-rc-file, --defaults-file TEXT
                                  The path to the OCI CLI-specific

                                  The --defaults-file option is deprecated and
                                  you should use the --cli-rc-file option
                                  instead.

                                  m.  [default: ~/.oci/oci_cli_rc]
  --opc-request-id, --opc-client-request-id, --request-id TEXT
                                  The request id to use for tracking the
                                  request.
  --region TEXT                   The region to make calls against.  For a
                                  list of valid region names use the command:
                                  "oci iam region list".
  --endpoint TEXT                 The value to use as the service endpoint,
                                  including any required API version path. For
                                  example: "https://iaas.us-
                                  phoenix-1.oracle.com/20160918". This will
                                  override the default service endpoint / API
                                  version path. Note: The --region parameter
                                  is the recommended way of targeting
                                  different regions.
  --realm-specific-endpoint       Use a realm-specific endpoint, instead of
                                  the default region-wide endpoint.
                                  
                                  Example::     oci os ns get --realm-
                                  specific-endpoint
                                  
                                  With this flag, your request will be made to
                                  a realm-specific service endpoint, such as,
                                  "https://mynamespace.objectstorage.us-
                                  phoenix-1.oci.customer-oci.com". Use the
                                  --debug option to identify which endpoint is
                                  used for your request.
                                  
                                  This flag has priority over the environment
                                  variable OCI_REALM_SPECIFIC_SERVICE_ENDPOINT
                                  _TEMPLATE_ENABLED.
                                  
                                  To use this flag by default, set this flag
                                  to true in your OCI CLI-specific
                                  configuration file. For more information,
                                  see https://docs.oracle.com/en-
                                  us/iaas/Content/API/SDKDocs/cliconfigure.htm
                                  
                                  If the flag is used for a service that does
                                  not support such feature, the default
                                  region-wide endpoint will be used.
  --connection-timeout INTEGER    The value of the connection timeout in
                                  seconds to make establish connection from
                                  sdk to services. This will override the
                                  default connection timeout value of 10 secs.
  --read-timeout INTEGER          The value of the read timeout in seconds to
                                  wait for service calls to send response to
                                  sdk. This will override the default read
                                  timeout value of 60 secs.
  --cert-bundle TEXT              The full path to a CA certificate bundle to
                                  be used for SSL verification. This will
                                  override the default CA certificate bundle.
  --output [json|table]           The output format. [Default is json]
  --query TEXT                    JMESPath query [http://jmespath.org/] to run

                                  Queries can be entered directly on the
                                  command line or referenced from the
                                  [OCI_CLI_COMMAND_ALIASES] section of your
                                  configuration file by using the syntax
                                  query://<query_name>, for example
                                  query://get_id_and_name

  --raw-output                    If the output of a given query is a single
                                  string value, this will return the string
                                  without surrounding quotes
  --auth [api_key|instance_principal|security_token|instance_obo_user|resource_principal|oke_workload_identity]
                                  The type of auth to use for the API request.
                                  By default the API key in your config file
                                  will be used.  This value can also be
                                  provided in the OCI_CLI_AUTH environment
                                  variable.
  --auth-purpose TEXT             The The auth purpose which can be used in
                                  conjunction with --auth.
  --generate-full-command-json-input
                                  Prints out a JSON document which represents
                                  all possible options that can be provided to
                                  this command.
                                  
                                  This JSON document can be saved to a file,
                                  modified with the appropriate option values,
                                  and then passed back via the --from-json
                                  option. This provides an alternative to
                                  typing options out on the command line.
